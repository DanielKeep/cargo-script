    With 1.15, linking on Windows was changed in regards to when it emits `dllimport`.  This means that the *old* code for linking to `FOLDERID_LocalAppData` no longer works.  Unfortunately, it *also* means that the *new* code doesn't work prior to 1.15.

    This controls which linking behaviour we need to work with.
